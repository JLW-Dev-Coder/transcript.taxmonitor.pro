          <div class="tm-prose mt-5 space-y-5 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>IRS transcript codes are standardized transaction codes that appear on IRS account transcripts and related records. Each code represents an action or status on the taxpayer’s account, such as return processing, credits applied, notices issued, holds placed, or payments posted.</p>
            <p>Professionals interpret codes in sequence, not in isolation. The same code can be routine in one context and meaningful in another depending on surrounding codes, dates, and amounts.</p>
            <p>Structured parsing helps by pulling the signal out of the noise. Instead of manually scanning a long transaction list, you can quickly identify the key milestones, explain what happened in plain English, and give clear next steps.</p>
            <p>Use the search box to find codes by number or keyword, then open the full meaning page for a professional interpretation, related patterns, and what to do next.</p>
